This is the assignment for ENSF 381's Lab 2. It was completed by Adam Yuen and Mohammed Zaid Shaikh.
What this repository contains is a website of sorts that has three pages: 
- a main page with two hyperlinks that lead to the News Page and the Images Page.
- The Images Page, which has cools picture on it, with some accompanying text.
- The News Page, which has various lists, text, and a table, and due to its length, has hyperlinks to jump to the different sections of the page.

This serves as a practice exercise for the introductory elements of Front End Development.
